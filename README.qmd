## Introduction

lotoseurosR is a collection of functions to aid the processing of inputs and outputs for the LOTOS-EUROS (LE) chemistry transport model https://lotos-euros.tno.nl/open-source-version/

All the functions are contained in the 'functions.R' file. The easiest way to reproduce them is to open the 'RUN_ME.R' file where the functions are used in code to generate the examples shown in this document.

Downloading the model and running with default settings will generate the output in the mod_files/output folder. The examples given in this document are based on these files but should also work with any surface LE model output files.

The input_surf_concs and input_surf_meteo will import the concentration or meteo outputs and output as a raster brick that can be plotted or used with openair, worldmet and saqgetr to visualise the data and assist with validation.

By converting to georeferenced raster layers and raster bricks, the process of extracting time-series, regridding (e.g. to combine with data on different grid systems/resolutions) and plotting is simplified and sped up. Layered image files can also be an efficient file format in terms of read/write speed and disk size, especially compared with dataframes (e.g. csv). It should be noted that saving raster files as other formats (e.g. native .RDS files) might appear to work, but they are linked to the memory. On restarting R they appear to be loaded, but when the RAM is cleared on restart they will be empty).

Below is a table of a some of the most common species. LE model outputs are either in kg or mole per mole. To convert these to volume it is neccesary to multiple by the molar weight and the temperature and pressure. This can be simplified by combining into an omrekenfactor factor which is multiplied by the mole mole value for species that change with volume. tmap_nam is the structure needed to format the species correctly in tmap.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(knitr)

source(file = "functions.R")

kable(varient_df, caption = "table of varient names")

```

Using the import_surf_concs function the surface concentration nc files are opened and data for o3 and no2 output.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, cache=FALSE, results=FALSE, error=FALSE}

mod_out <- import_surf_concs(species = c('o3','no2'), path = 'files/output', output_units = 'volume')


```

The plotting function mod_plot will plot the output just generated for o3. Each hour is animated up to a maximum of 64. 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}

mod_plot(raster_list = mod_out, file_path = 'plots/rmd/', variable = 'o3')

```

As the model domain is quite large it is a good idea to reduce it. Using the function get_country_domain a boundary box for a specific country, in this case Greece, is returned

```{r echo=TRUE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, cache=FALSE, results=FALSE, error=FALSE}

sub_domain <- get_country_domain(countries = c('Greece'))

```

In this domain we are interested in the observation sites that are available for the period of the model data and the species. Using the function find_aq_sites the saqgetr pakcage is used to interogate a database with European pollutant observation data (described here in more detail https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IgDODHqBHewCTKLdAAxRyR7ml8ht6Ods/view). The period of data requested is based on the layer names in the raster file, so it shouldn't be neccesary to filter the returned data. 

The function plot_obs generates a leaflet plot colouring the observation sites by type and area.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, cache=FALSE, error=FALSE}

obs_sites <- find_aq_sites(raster_list = mod_out, domain = sub_domain, type_def = c('background'), area_def = c('urban', 'rural', 'suburban'), species = c('o3'))

plot_obs(sites_sf = obs_sites, variable = 'o3')

```

The mod_obs_combine function joins the modelled and observed data, shown below.

```{r echo=TRUE}

mod_obs <- mod_obs_combine(raster_list = mod_out, sites_sf = obs_sites, species = 'o3')

s_mo <- slice(mod_obs, 1:15)

```

```{r echo=FALSE}

library(knitr)

kable(s_mo, caption = "snapshot of modelled and observed concentrations")

```

This data is now in the correct format to be input into many useful openair functions (https://bookdown.org/david_carslaw/openair/). Below is the modStats function which calculates model statistics showing how well the modelled outputs compare with observed. This can be done for all rows or split, in this case by site type.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, cache=FALSE, error=FALSE}

ms_sites <- modStats(mod_obs, obs = "obs", mod = "mod",
         type = c("site"))

ms_all <- modStats(mod_obs, obs = "obs", mod = "mod")

```

Model statistics for all observation locations

```{r echo = FALSE}

kable(ms_all, caption = "model statistics for all ")

#time_dygraph(concs_dat, variable = c(all_labs[c(3,7,8,9,10)], 'Total'), ylab = spec_df$dg_nam[1])

#p1 <- plot_obs(data_brick = )

```

Model statistics split by site

```{r echo = FALSE}

kable(ms_sites, caption = "model statistics split by site")


```

Below are some examples of plots.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

scatterPlot(mod_obs_1, x = "mod", y = "obs", 
            pch = 21:22, cex = 1.6, 
            fill = c("tomato"), 
            col = "white", 
            linear = TRUE, 
            xlab = "modelled (ug/m3)", 
            ylab = "observed (ug/m3)")

```

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

scatterPlot(mod_obs_1,
            x = "mod", y = "obs",
            method = "density",
            xlab = "modelled (ug/m3)", 
            ylab = "observed (ug/m3)")

```

```

<!-- If desired all species can be output from the model and plot using the CorPlot. The species available in the default model are: 'o3','no2', 'no', 'hno3', 'nh3', 'so2', 'co', 'n2o5', 'form', 'iso', 'pan', 'no3a_f', 'no3a_c', 'so4a_f', 'so4a_c', 'nh4a_f', 'ppm_f', 'ppm_c', 'ec_f', 'ec_c', 'pom_f', 'pom_c', 'na_ff', 'na_f', 'na_c', 'na_cc', 'na_ccc', 'dust_ff', 'dust_f', 'dust_c', 'dust_cc', 'dust_ccc', 'tpm25', 'tpm10', 'tnmvoc', 'tdust', 'tss' Also for the same location. -->

Meteo data can be imported in the same way and also plot as a sequental hourly plot. Below is a plot of temperature for the full domain.

In the example files wind speed and direction are also output.
